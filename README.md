The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting apartment prices in Buenos Aires using linear regression with a focus on apartments that cost less than $400000.

**Problem Statement**

In the real estate market, accurate price predictions are crucial for buyers, sellers, and realtors. Buenos Aires, Argentina, has a dynamic and competitive housing market, but predicting apartment prices remains a challenge due to various factors such as location, size, and market trends. Traditional methods of estimating prices may not capture the complexity of the data, resulting in inaccurate forecasts.

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting apartment prices in Buenos Aires using linear regression. This model will leverage data wrangling and visualization techniques to preprocess real estate data, handle missing values, and encode categorical features. The project will focus on creating a robust data pipeline to minimize overfitting and enhance model performance. Additionally, a dynamic dashboard will be developed to allow users to interact with the model and gain insights into price predictions.

This predictive tool aims to provide valuable insights to various stakeholders in the Buenos Aires real estate market, offering more accurate price estimates and aiding decision-making.
